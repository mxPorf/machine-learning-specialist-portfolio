# US Parks Biodiversity
The goal of this analytics project is to clean, process and extract information from observations of animals and plants in four US National Parks, and then organize the results of into a presentation meant to explain the technical results to a broad audience.

The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly observations from species in different US national parks.

This project will analyze, prepare and plot data. The findings of the analysis are organized into a presentation  meant to explain technical results to a broad audience.

### Project Overview
The extraction, cleaning, processing, plotting and anaylis is done in the `biodiversity.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, the reader is encouraged to look into that notebook to find the bulk of the analysis and Python code used for the project.
The slide deck `Biodiversity_analysis.pdf` contains a friendly presentation of all the steps in the project, as an overview of the most important work done.

### Data
This project uses a subset of the Dataset by the (US) National Park Service that collects data about plant and animal species found in the US national park system. The complete source can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity)

##### References
This project was completed in Python, using Pandas and NumPy for cleaning and analysis. It also used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot and visualize the data.
